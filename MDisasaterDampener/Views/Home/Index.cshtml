    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
        Founded in 2010, the Relief Effort Organization was established to provide immediate
        assistance to communities affected by natural disasters and crises. Over the years,
        we have expanded our reach to support hundreds of relief efforts worldwide.
        From earthquake responses in Southeast Asia to flood relief in Africa, our team
        has been on the ground, helping those in need.
